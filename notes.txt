For the a-type deflector, use the following lines in CMIfly.py:
  deflector_fieldnorm_filename     = 'deflector_field_norm'
  deflector_fieldgradient_filename = 'deflector_field_gradient'
  # deflector_voltage for which the fields were calculated (kV)
  deflector_field_voltage = 5.
  # geometric boundary of the deflector
  rod_center = [0, 0.0036] # rod center (x,y)
  rod_radius = 0.003 # rod radius
  trough_center = [0, 0.002408] # trough center (x,y)
  trough_radius = 0.0032 # trough radius

For the b-type deflector, use the following lines in CMIfly.py:
  deflector_fieldnorm_filename     = 'Ec.norm.txt'
  deflector_fieldgradient_filename = 'gt.grad.txt' 
  # deflector_voltage for which the fields were calculated (kV)
  deflector_field_voltage = 60.
  # geometric boundary of the deflector
  rod_center = [0, 0.0036] # rod center (x,y)
  rod_radius = 0 #0.003 # rod radius
  trough_center = [0, 0.002408] # trough center (x,y)
  trough_radius = 0 #0.0032 # trough radius
Since the rod_radius = 0, it will now use the fields to determine the edge of the deflector
