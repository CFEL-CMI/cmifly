# CMI fly

A simple Python program for trajectory-based simulations of the deflection of molecular beams in
inhomogeneous electric fields.

The initial version of this code was published in the following paper and any use of the code should
reference that publication:

> molecules and their applications, [_International Reviews in Physical Chemistry_ **34**, 557–590
> (2015)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0144235x.2015.1077838); [arXiv:1505.05632
> [physics]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05632).

details.


## Getting Started with CMIfly

For now, get the latest version from [github](https://github.com/CFEL-CMI/cmifly) and run
`CMIfly.py`.


## Documentation

For now, this code is undocumented; this needs to be changed.


## ToDo

Convert this to an installable Python package using setuptools and provide, at least, basic
documentation.
